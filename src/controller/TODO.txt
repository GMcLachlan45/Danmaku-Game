For the Controller side of this project, there needs to be a way to 
control what is going on on the screen
This will likely involve taking the keyboard input and then sending it 
off to the model for processing

So:
TODO: find an elegant system to handle keyboard input
TODO: allow for control customization

Stretch TODO: detect and allow gamepad input
